# Fake-Printer
Python fake printer for demoing how default credentials can result in retrieving domain credentials

This is a simple flask implementation that I used GhatGPT to help with for a presentation, running python webserver.py will launch a fake printer with default credentials which in turn can be used with a ldap server of your choice to relay the saved credential to the attacker ldap server.
